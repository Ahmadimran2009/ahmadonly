 Ahmad had always been fascinated by technology and dreamed of building his own website from scratch. One sunny afternoon, he decided it was time to turn his dream into a reality. Ahmad started by drafting a blueprint for his website. He envisioned a sleek, modern site with a clean layout, a blog section, and a gallery to showcase his coding projects. Armed with this plan, he began to tackle the coding journey.First, Ahmad chose a domain name: “AhmadTechJourney.com.” He registered it and found a reliable hosting service that offered the resources he needed. With these essential elements in place, he was ready to dive into coding.Ahmad’s first task was to set up the website structure using HTML. He created the foundational elements: a header, a navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer. The lines of code slowly started to build the skeleton of his site.

Next, he used CSS to style his website. Ahmad played with colors, fonts, and layouts, giving his site a polished and professional look. He added media queries to ensure the design looked great on both desktops and mobile devices.

With the visual design taking shape, Ahmad moved on to JavaScript. He wrote scripts to add interactive features, like a responsive navigation menu and a dynamic gallery that displayed his coding projects. Each piece of code he wrote made his site come to life. Once the initial build was complete, Ahmad tested his website thoroughly. He checked every link, ensured the forms worked correctly, and reviewed the site’s performance on different browsers. Debugging became a part of his daily routine as he fixed errors and optimized his code. After weeks of hard work, Ahmad was ready for the big reveal. He uploaded his files to the hosting server, and with a mix of excitement and nervousness, he pointed his domain to the new site. As the website went live, Ahmad refreshed his browser and saw his creation on the screen. The sense of accomplishment was immense.
