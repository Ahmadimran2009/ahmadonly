# 1. Fridge API blog introduction

The Fridge Feature helps users manage ingredients and discover recipes based on what they have on hand. Users can add ingredients (e.g., "tomato, mozzarella, basil") to their virtual fridge, which are stored and linked to their user ID for personalized use. Through various endpoints, users can add ingredients via a POST request, retrieve their stored ingredients with a GET request, or search for recipes that utilize their available items. This functionality simplifies meal planning and reduces waste by making the most of existing ingredients.

# 2. Frontend Features

# Adding your ingredients

const addFridgeBtn = document.getElementById('addFridgeBtn');
const ingredientsInput = document.getElementById('ingredients');
const userIdInput = document.getElementById('user_id');
const fridgeList = document.getElementById('fridgeList');

const API_URL = "http://localhost:8887/fridge";

// Add ingredients to fridge
addFridgeBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
            method: 'POST', // Specifies a POST request
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json', // Sets the content type as JSON
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                ingredients: ingredientsInput.value, // Ingredients input by user
                user_id: userIdInput.value,         // User ID input by user
            }),
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const data = await response.json();
        alert('Ingredients added successfully');
        displayFridgeItems(userIdInput.value); // Refreshes the fridge list for the user
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        alert(`An error occurred: ${error.message}`);
    }
});

This code enables users to add ingredients and their User ID to a virtual fridge by clicking a button. When the button is clicked, it triggers an event listener that sends a POST request to a backend API. The request includes the ingredients and User ID as JSON data. If the request is successful, it alerts the user and refreshes the displayed list of ingredients for that specific User ID by calling a function to fetch and show the updated fridge contents. If there's an error, it alerts the user and logs the issue for debugging.

# code for submitting ingredients

addFridgeBtn.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                ingredients: ingredientsInput.value,
                user_id: userIdInput.value,
            }),
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const data = await response.json();
        alert('Ingredients added successfully');
        displayFridgeItems(userIdInput.value);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        alert(`An error occurred: ${error.message}`);
    }
});

The code allows users to submit their ingredients and user ID to a server. When the "Add Ingredients to Fridge" button is clicked, an event listener triggers a POST request to the specified API endpoint (API_URL). It sends the ingredients and user ID as JSON in the request body. If the server responds successfully, an alert notifies the user that the ingredients were added, and the fridge items for the given user are refreshed by calling the displayFridgeItems function. If an error occurs, the code logs the error and alerts the user with a descriptive message, ensuring clear feedback for both success and failure scenarios.

# 3. Backend features

# Post creation endpoint

@fridge_api.route('/fridge', methods=['POST'])
def add_ingredients():
    try:
        # Log request data
        logger.debug("Request headers: %s", request.headers)
        logger.debug("Request data: %s", request.data)

        # Parse request JSON
        data = request.get_json()
        if not data:
            logger.error("Invalid JSON data")
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid JSON data'}), 400

        ingredients_list = data.get('ingredients')
        user_identifier = data.get('user_id')

        # Validate required fields
        if not ingredients_list:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Ingredients are required'}), 400
        if not user_identifier:
            return jsonify({'error': 'user_id is required'}), 400

        # Add to database
        new_fridge = Fridge(ingredients=ingredients_list, user_id=user_identifier)
        new_fridge.create()  # Assuming this method inserts the data into the database
        return jsonify(new_fridge.read()), 201  # Responds with the created fridge item and a 201 status code

    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Error while adding ingredients")  # Logs any error that occurs
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500  # Returns a 500 status code if an error happens

The code defines a POST endpoint (/fridge) that allows users to add ingredients to their virtual fridge. It first logs the request data and checks if the incoming JSON contains the necessary fields (ingredients and user_id). If any of these are missing, it responds with an error message and a 400 status. Upon receiving valid data, a new Fridge object is created with the provided ingredients and user ID, and it's inserted into the database using the create() method. If the operation succeeds, the API returns the created fridge item with a 201 status. If an error occurs, it's logged, and a 500 status code is returned.

# Post retreival endpoint

# Get fridge items
@fridge_api.route('/fridge', methods=['GET'])
def get_fridge():
    try:
        # Get user_id from query parameters
        user_id = request.args.get('user_id')
        
        # Validate that user_id is provided
        if not user_id:
            return jsonify({'error': 'user_id is required'}), 400

        # Query fridge items for the given user_id
        fridges = Fridge.query.filter_by(_user_id=user_id).all()

        # Return the list of fridge items
        return jsonify([fridge.read() for fridge in fridges]), 200

    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error if something goes wrong
        logger.exception("Error while fetching fridge items")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

This code listens for GET requests at the /fridge endpoint, fetches the fridge items based on the provided user_id in the query parameters, and returns the results in JSON format. If the user_id is missing or an error occurs during the retrieval, it returns an appropriate error message.

# Database functionality

def initFridge():
    """
    Initialize the Fridge table and add sample data to the table.
    """
    with app.app_context():
        """Create database and tables"""
        db.create_all()
        
        """Sample data for fridge entries"""
        fridges = [
            Fridge(ingredients='chicken, garlic, lemon', user_id=1, recipes=[]),
            Fridge(ingredients='tomato, mozzarella, basil', user_id=1, recipes=[]),
            Fridge(ingredients='potato, cheese, butter', user_id=2, recipes=[]),
        ]
        
        for fridge in fridges:
            try:
                fridge.create()
                print(f"Record created: {repr(fridge)}")
            except IntegrityError:
                db.session.remove()
                print(f"Record already exists or error: {fridge._ingredients}")

This code initializes the Fridge table by first creating all tables with db.create_all() and then adds some sample data entries into the fridge table.

# 4. API communication

const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        ingredients: ingredientsInput.value,
        user_id: userIdInput.value,
    }),
});

This code implements a user interface for managing ingredients in a virtual fridge, with API communication to handle data storage and retrieval. When users input their ingredients and user ID, they can click a button that triggers a POST request to an API endpoint (http://localhost:8887/fridge), sending the data as JSON. If successful, it confirms the addition and fetches the updated fridge contents via a GET request to the same API with the user's ID as a query parameter. The response, containing the user's stored ingredients, is dynamically displayed on the page. This functionality ensures seamless interaction between the frontend and backend, enabling users to manage their fridge items easily.

The frontend uses

fetch()

to send JSON payloads and handle responses, as shown below:

const response = await fetch(`${pythonURI}/api/post`, { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify(postData) });

# 5. challenges and improvement

Challenges

    -Enabling automatic updates for the map.
    -Managing errors when the API behaves unexpectedly.
    -Troubleshooting API responses to identify issues.

Improvements
