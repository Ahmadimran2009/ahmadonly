in the beginning of sprint 2, after the formation of our teams, we made our lessons for javascript and pyton my /group did the 3.3 and 3.5 lessons.  worked on the popcorn hacks for 3.3 and created the homework, while my group tackled other parts. we also helped eachother along the way and asked the teacher for guidance if we really needed to. in 3.3 we went over important mathematical terms and how to use tehm in python and javascript. in 3.5 we focused on booleons, how they work and how to use them in python and javascript. After the lesson I learned many new and interesting stuff about arrays, if statements, mathematical operations, logical operators, variables and strings all in python and javascript. This should have significantly help me for the college board AP test because we learned a lot about the the different topics that will be on the exam and more stuff that will be tested.
